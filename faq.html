  <main class="faq-container">
    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you deliver anywhere in New England?</h3>
      <p>No, not just anywhere. I prefer to setup only at approved campground sites and do not allow the camper to be moved once setup. There are some places I will consider such as fairgrounds, some festivals, and other events. My preferred distance of travel is within 69 miles of Milford, NH which keeps my travel time under 2 hours one-way and the cost you pay for delivery to a minimum. I charge $1.90/mi from Milford, NH and have a minimum $135 delivery fee. About the furthest I will go is North Conway, NH or North Waterford, ME.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>I have a truck, can I tow your camper instead of paying for delivery?</h3>
      <p>For safety and insurance reasons, no. Even if you’ve been towing big rigs all your life and have the most powerful, coolest truck ever, no.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What time is checkin and checkout?</h3>
      <p>It depends on the campground, but most don’t allow checking in before 2pm and checkout is usually 11am. I ask you please allow me 1 hour before checkout time in order to break down the camper. I will work with you to schedule a convenient time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you allow pets?</h3>
      <p>Yes! I do not allow cats mainly because I have one and I know that cats can be a$$holes. But dogs are awesome and more than welcome as long as you take responsibility for them and any damages they do (chewing, ripping, tearing screens, stains, smells, over cooking bacon).</p>
      <p>Check with campgrounds before bringing your dog to make sure you have all documents needed. Pets can cause damage to furniture, flooring, doors, and windows. Only the pet owner knows how their pet will behave unattended so I suggest you minimize the time you leave your pet in the camper while you are not there. Crates are a good way of ensuring that your pet doesn’t get into trouble and can be setup inside the camper.</p>
      <p>Any stains, smells, rips, tears, or other damage done by your pet is the renter’s responsibility. The renter may be charged up to $250 cleaning fee for any stains/odors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is your cleaning policy?</h3>
      <p>Please note there is absolutely no smoking. And no GLITTER! At the last day of your stay please make sure all of the items you brought have been removed. This includes any food in the fridge (unopened beers or leftover rum is acceptable). Please wash all dishes, cups, pots, silverware used and clean the grill surface if used. Please sweep the floors to clean up all dirt, sand, leaves, and fur and wipe down the counter tops and surfaces in the bathroom.</p>
      <p>Broom, paper towels, general purpose cleaner, and Clorox wipes can be found in the campers for cleaning up. If there are any pet messes PLEASE clean it and let me know as stain and odor remover applied quickly enough can prevent damage and prevent an additional $150 cleaning fee.</p>
      <p>The campers have NEVER been smoked in. If I detect a smoke odor in the camper you will be charged a minimum $500 cleaning fee. Cushions, mattresses, and other upholstery may also need to be replaced which the renter would also be liable for the cost of replacement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What do you supply?</h3>
      <p>Both campers are stocked with a set of dishes, cups, mugs, plates, and utensils to accommodate your family. There are TP, paper towels, sponges and cleaning supplies. There is a single brew coffee maker and some coffee pods as well. I try to keep some s’more supplies handy as well. Each camper will have its own grill and propane tank. I make sure that at least one tank of propane is full for heating the camper. I also offer some extra things as add-ons for additional charge such as kayaks, easy-up, generator, and bundles of wood.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
      <p>Bring any and all bedding for your stay (pillows, sheets, blanket, sleeping bags). Both campers have a queen size bed for the main bed and then just whatever you’ve got can fit on the bunks or the pull outs. There is plenty of refrigerator room as both campers have indoor and outdoor fridges (outdoor is great for keeping the drinks you’ll want the most accessible when you’re out enjoying the fire or the day).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Can I rent your campers on Outdoorsy?</h3>
      <p>Yes. I’ve been on Outdoorsy since 2019 and rent to many people through there still. But I’m weird and like to save you and me money. You’ll save on average 20% going direct through me instead of using the 3rd party platforms because they charge service fees and insurance which you don’t need. You can find the listings for my campers here:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.outdoorsy.com/dashboard/rentals/448145" target="_blank">2018 32' Coachman Freedom Express Liberty Edition</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.outdoorsy.com/dashboard/rentals/291223" target="_blank">2022 25' Coachmen Apex Nano</a></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>How do we book a trip directly with you?</h3>
      <p>Send me a request with the dates you want to go and where and some details such as the type of site and which camper. I’ll send you a quote/rental contract by email. I request $50 as a non-refundable deposit to hold the booking. Sending the deposit is acceptance of the rental contact/agreement. Payments by Venmo (<strong>@shanehooker653</strong>) or PayPal (<strong>@shanehooker1</strong>) are preferred or by personal check. I request you pay 50% of the balance at least 2 weeks prior to your rental start in order to keep the booking. The balance is due at the time of the rental start.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do you book the camp site too?</h3>
      <p>Typically I don’t. Most of my renters already have their camp site at the campground secured. But if you are flexible and would like me to book a site based on dates and my recommendation I’m happy to do it for you. I would just add the cost of the site based on the campground fees onto your bill.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is your cancellation policy?</h3>
      <p>You can cancel for any reason up to 2 weeks prior to your rental start and I will refund anything you’ve paid in excess of the non-refundable $50. After that it depends on the time of cancellation.</p>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
        <tr><th>Time Period</th><th>Refund</th></tr>
        <tr><td>$50 non-refundable deposit</td><td>$0</td></tr>
        <tr><td>&gt; 2 weeks before rental start</td><td>100% amount paid (less non-refundable)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7–13 days before rental start</td><td>50% amount paid (less non-refundable)</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0–6 days before rental start</td><td>25% amount paid (less non-refundable)</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Should you decide to leave your stay early for non-emergency related reasons I cannot refund you for the days not used.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What happens if something isn’t working while I’m camping?</h3>
      <p>You can just text or call me anytime and I’ll walk you through it. But the awesome thing about campers is that they are pretty friendly and helpful people. If it’s something simple and you’re just not familiar odds are there is someone camping right near you who would be happy to help.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What places would you recommend camping at?</h3>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Why do you hate glitter?</h3>
      <p>I don’t hate glitter, I just question the intentions of anyone who brings glitter with them on a camping trip and lets their pre-K kids do arts and crafts inside a camper on a rainy day. Glitter…gets…everywhere…forever!</p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Are you sure you don't hate glitter?</h3>
      <p>If I find any glitter I will hunt you down!</p>
